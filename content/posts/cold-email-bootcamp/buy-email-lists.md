## How to Build Your Email Lists
-----------------------------

There are several ways to build your email list. One way is to do a manual search of the emails that are available to the public eye.

These emails could be on social media sites like:

*   LinkedIn
*   Facebook
*   Twitter
*   TikTok
*   Instagram

You can also look on the About Us or Contact Us page to find these emails. You could also start a newsletter or a subscription to receive emails for a certain amount of time.

Sometimes you will need more help in finding the emails. Getting LinkedIn Premium can help you in accessing this information. You can start up a conversation with anyone you aren't connected to.

Another way is using places that you can buy lists of emails from. Here at EMAILzipcode we do just that. If you need emails in a specific zip code, we specialize in it.

You can start using your social media to promote a newsletter and get people to subscribe to be on your email list.

## Managing Your Email Lists
-------------------------

When you make a plan for a newsletter, start telling others that you are getting ready to release it. You will need to have software that can help you in areas that would be time-consuming if you did it all yourself.

Software like Mailchimp gives you [insights on email campaigns](https://mailchimp.com/features/email/) and tracks your sales. Mailchimp helps take care of the technical stuff so you can focus on the more important things. WordPress works well with Mailchimp.

One of the best-rated [email marketing software](https://www.sendinblue.com/features/email-marketing/) is Sendinblue. This email software will help marketers in automating their follow-ups. Sendinblue helps save time and makes your job easier.

Having software will help you know what parts of your email campaigns are working and which ones are not. It is helpful in knowing what you need to scrap and what you can improve on.

## Data Scrubbing Your Email Lists
-------------------------------

We all check our spam folders to see if an email got stuck in spam when it shouldn't be.

Making sure your email won't go into someone's spam folder is daunting. You need to know which emails are valid and are invalid.

You also need to know if your bounce rate is high, so you can reduce it when needed. Too high of a bounce rate, and you get sent to spam. There is an average [bounce rate of 10.12%](https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/5409-average-industry-rates?lang=en_US) for all industries.

So, when you need to verify your email lists, you need to have the lists ready. You can do this manually or you can go to EMAILzipcode to get the validation and cleaning of the emails.

We use a third-party database and [guarantee a 95%+](https://emailzipcode.net/faq.php) deliverable on valid emails.

## Plan to Customize and Personalize Emails
----------------------------------------

You need to have a plan when it comes to making emails. To start, you need to be aware of who your target audience is and what their pain points are. This will help you make your subject line and also the body of the email.

Sending the same email to everyone can be off-putting. Sure, you might get some responses, but you will end up turning others away.

Research the person you will be emailing and use what you learn about them in your emails. Make it known that you actually care for them enough to not email them out of the blue.

### Coming Up With Subject Lines

Subject lines are the first thing people pay attention to when going through their emails. You don't want to have a generic subject line that would make them turn away.

Address their pain point in a short and simple way that makes them feel like it is urgent that they click on it.

Personalizing the subject line is just the start. You still have the body to do.

### Writing the Body of the Email

The research you have done will come in handy when you start on the body of the email. Use their name in the greeting.

If the person has a blog, take a moment to read a few posts and gather a list of what you liked about them. These notes that you make will help in making the email tailored to them.

Do not make the email long, and do not lump the text together.

Some people have trouble reading a big clump of text, and others will stop reading if they don't get a break from the text. Make the text digestible and short.

Do not use a template unless you can make customizations to make it fit the person.

Talk about the person and not all about you. Do not make it where it seems like all you are trying to do is sell a product or service.
