A good [rule of thumb](https://sahilbloom.substack.com/p/the-cold-email-guide) is to include at least 30 recipients in your campaign. Much less than this, and the data you get can be hard to learn from.

A time-tested and often spoken about way of measuring the success of your campaign is an A/B test.

Simply put, this involves comparing test email 'A' with test email 'B,' both being sent to the same amount of customers. The results can then be measured for further refinement of your campaign to make it even better!

How to Optimize Your Outreach for Greater Results
-------------------------------------------------

Looking at specific ways to tailor your message will be key to success. From opens, to click-through-rate, to overall engagement, here are the ways to polish your campaigns.

### **What Are Some Ways to Increase Click-Through Rates**

*   *   Am I using an ‘anchor text?’ (highlighted term that links to your page)
    *   Can an image with a link improve your readership rates?
    *   Is the Call to Action clear and concise? Do your readers know where they are being asked to ‘go?’ And why?
    *   And finally: does the destination page fit campaign goals perfectly?

All these points are vital considerations when crafting your email. Take care of these technical bases and you can help raise conversions through the roof!

### **How Can I Get People to Read My Cold Email Campaign**

*   *   Is your delivery system working? Are your cold emails being delivered to the right place?
    *   Do I have the right email lists? Are my email addresses lists full of valid customers?
    *   Does the ‘Subject’ line itself need revisions?
    *   Am I sending it at the right time?

Making sure your emails make it to the ‘Inbox’ of your intended audience is key. After all, they can’t read your carefully crafted message if it does not arrive in the first place!

Once it is delivered, testing different forms of subject lines can pay dividends.

### **Ways to Raise Engagement and Response to Your Cold Emails**

*   *   Consider your greeting. Can it be made more engaging? More impactful?
    *   Was a template employed? Can customizations improve it?
    *   Make the length appropriate. Clear and to the point messaging is your friend.
    *   Similarly, make the solution to customer’s pain points clear with your message. In as few words as possible, share that you know their pain and can provide an answer.
